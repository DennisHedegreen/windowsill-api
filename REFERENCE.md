## Important

Windowsill gives growing recommendations, not guarantees. A `match_score` of 1.0 means the climate conditions match the plant's requirements — it does not account for local microclimate, soil quality, wind exposure, building shade, container size, watering practice, or pests. Use scores as a starting point, not a promise.

## Scoring model

### Windowsill

Indoors — outdoor temperature is irrelevant.

| Factor | Weight |
|---|---|
| Sun match | 0.60 |
| Habit (windowsill rating) | 0.40 |
| Temperature | not used |

### Balcony

Outdoor containers. Frost penalty applied when frost is less than 4 weeks away (max −0.30 to temperature score).

| Factor | Weight |
|---|---|
| Temperature match | 0.45 |
| Sun match | 0.35 |
| Habit (balcony rating) | 0.20 |

### Garden

Full outdoor exposure. Frost penalty applied when frost is less than 6 weeks away (max −0.40 to temperature score).

| Factor | Weight |
|---|---|
| Temperature match | 0.50 |
| Sun match | 0.30 |
| Habit (garden rating) | 0.20 |

### Temperature curve

Quadratic penalty from optimal temperature. Score drops to 0 below `min_temp` or above `max_temp`.

### Timing

Frost-hardy plants (`hardiness_temp ≤ −2°C`) are not blocked by frost — assessed on whether they can establish before frost arrives.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ok` | Enough time before frost to reach harvest |
| `tight` | Possible — start immediately |
| `too_late` | Not enough time before frost |
| `year_round` | No frost expected at this latitude |

## Plant schema

Each plant is one JSON file in `api/plants/`. IDs: `WSL-0001` format.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique ID — WSL-0001 format |
| `name_en` | string | English variety name |
| `name_da` | string | Danish variety name |
| `name_latin` | string | Latin/botanical name including cultivar |
| `family` | string | Botanical family |
| `genus` | string | Botanical genus |
| `species` | string | Common species slug, e.g. `basil` |
| `type` | enum | `op` `heirloom` `hybrid` |
| `min_temp` | float °C | Lowest temperature for active growth |
| `max_temp` | float °C | Highest temperature tolerated |
| `optimal_temp` | float °C | Optimal growing temperature |
| `hardiness_temp` | float °C | Coldest survival temperature (overwinter tolerance — distinct from min_temp) |
| `hardiness_zone_min` | integer | USDA zone derived from hardiness_temp |
| `sun_hours` | float | Minimum direct sun hours per day |
| `sun_direct` | enum | `full` `partial` `shade` |
| `context` | array | Suitable growing contexts |
| `grow_time_weeks` | integer | Weeks from seed to first harvest |
| `weeks_from_transplant` | integer | Weeks from transplant to first harvest |
| `habit` | object | Per-context suitability: `good` `acceptable` `risky` `unsuitable` |
| `notes` | string | Growing notes, culinary use, special requirements |

### min_temp vs hardiness_temp

`min_temp` is the temperature at which the plant stops growing.  
`hardiness_temp` is the temperature it can survive.

Example: Peppermint has `min_temp: 5°C` (stops growing in cold) but `hardiness_temp: −29°C` (survives winter as a dormant rhizome — USDA zone 5).

### USDA zone from hardiness_temp

| hardiness_temp | Zone |
|---|---|
| ≤ −34°C | 4 |
| −34 to −29°C | 5 |
| −29 to −23°C | 6 |
| −23 to −18°C | 7 |
| −18 to −12°C | 8 |
| −12 to −7°C | 9 |
| −7 to −1°C | 10 |
| −1 to +4°C | 11 |
| +4 to +10°C | 12 |
| > +10°C | 13 |

## Data sources

**Climate data:** Open-Meteo Archive API — global historical data 2003–2022. When unavailable, temperature is estimated from latitude (`data_confidence: low`).

**Sun calculation:** Astronomical calculation from latitude, orientation, and month. No external API.

**Plant library:** Maintained in this repository. Community contributions via pull request.

**USDA zones:** Estimated from latitude. Will be replaced with Open-Meteo winter data in a future version.
