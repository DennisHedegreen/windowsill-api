# Windowsill

Geo-climate edible plant growing recommendation API.

Send a GPS coordinate, a growing context, and a week number — get back the best plants to grow for that exact location, based on historical climate data and astronomical sun calculations.

**Live API:** https://api.windowsill.dk  
**Documentation:** https://windowsill.dk/docs.html  
**Plant library:** https://windowsill.dk/library.html  
**Contribute a plant:** https://windowsill.dk/contribute.html

Repository library state: 148 varieties.

Deployment note: verify `GET /v1/status` after deployment before claiming the live API has the same plant count.

curl "https://api.windowsill.dk/v1/recommend?lat=55.67&lng=12.57&orientation=S&context=garden&week=22"

# With shuffle — different top picks each call
curl "https://api.windowsill.dk/v1/recommend?lat=55.67&lng=12.57&orientation=SE&context=balcony&week=22&shuffle=true"

# Exclude plants you already have

## Plant library

148 edible plant varieties.

The original seeded library contained 145 varieties across four groups:

- Herbs and spices (85 varieties)
- Summer vegetables (25 varieties)
- Perennial garden herbs (20 varieties)
- Cold-tolerant / winter crops (15 varieties)

Additional release-candidate contributions currently include:

- Sacha Culantro
- Oca
- Ulluco

Each variety is one JSON file in `plants/`. IDs follow the format `WSL-0001`.

## Contribute a plant

The library is open. To add a variety:

1. Fork this repository
2. Find the next available ID in `plants/` (currently WSL-0149+)
3. Create `plants/WSL-0149-your-plant-name.json` following the schema in [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#plant-schema)
4. Add the filename to `plants/index.json`
5. Update the `count` value in `plants/index.json`
6. Open a pull request — include your data source in the description
